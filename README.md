In this project, I have assumed the role of a back-end developer working for an online retailer selling books. I have been tasked with developing a server-side application that stores, retrieves and manages book ratings and reviews.

The server-side application is required to provide the following features and capabilities to allow users to:
Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the book’s ISBN code, author names and titles
Retrieve reviews/comments to particular books
Register as a new user of the application
Login to the application
Add a new review for a book (Only logged-in users)
Modify a book review (logged-in users can modify only their reviews)
Delete a book review (logged-in users can delete only their reviews)
(Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously

 

I have developed the code further to implement the CRUD capabilities as HTTP methods in my Express server and tested them using Postman. You will also implement Session and JWTauthentication to allow only logged-in users to perform certain operations.
I have enhanced the code using Promises, Callbacks or Async/Await functions to allow multiple users to interact with the applications simultaneously without waiting for each other’s operations to complete.
